# What is Anxiety?

Anxiety is a mental and physical reaction to perceived threats. In moderation, it can be helpful, but excessive anxiety can be debilitating.

## Understanding Anxiety

- **Definition**: Anxiety is a response to anticipated danger, real or imagined, and involves physical, cognitive, and behavioral changes.
- **Similarity to Fear**: Anxiety is similar to fear but is often about potential danger that may not be real.

## Fight/Flight Response

- **Reaction to Threat**: When threatened, our bodies react with a fight/flight response to protect us from danger.
- **Physical System Changes**: Major temporary changes occur in our body systems when we perceive danger.

## Physical Changes in Anxiety

1. **Increased Heart Rate**: Prepares the body to respond to danger.
2. **Redistribution of Blood**: Blood flows away from areas that aren't as vital to those needed for a quick response.
3. **Changes in Breathing**: Breathing becomes faster and shallower, preparing for action.
