# What Are Core Beliefs?

Understanding and challenging core beliefs is crucial as they are the root of unhelpful thought patterns. These deeply held beliefs are often absolute and rigid, making them resistant to change.

## Challenging Core Beliefs

- Recognize difficulty in letting go of unhelpful thoughts due to deeply ingrained core beliefs.
- Core beliefs can be too broad, impacting various aspects of life.
- Challenge these beliefs by questioning the evidence supporting them and writing down a more balanced belief.

## Identifying Themes from Thought Diaries

- Start with identifying recurring patterns in your Thought Diaries.
- Look for common themes in how you talk about yourself, others, and the world.
  
## Identifying A Core Belief

- Identifying core beliefs involves looking beyond surface thoughts to what lies underneath.
- Ask questions about what these beliefs say about you.

## Behavioural Experiments

- Conduct experiments to challenge core beliefs by:
  1. Writing down the core belief.
  2. Thinking of tasks that could test this belief.
  3. Writing down expected outcomes.
  4. Carrying out the tasks.
  5. Recording what actually happened.
  6. Comparing results with expected outcomes and updating beliefs accordingly.

## Following Through

- To solidify new, balanced core beliefs, write them down and remind yourself of these beliefs, especially when triggered.
- Affirm these balanced beliefs with positive self-statements.
- Challenge and replace unhelpful beliefs consistently to integrate them into your belief system.
