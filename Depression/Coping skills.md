# Coping Skills

## Behavioral Activation

Depression saps a person's energy to do just about anything—even activities they enjoy. As a result, people with depression tend to become less active, which causes the depression to worsen. However, even a little bit of activity can help stop this cycle.

1. **Choose activities you are likely to complete.**
   - Exercise
   - Socialize
   - Responsibilities
   - Hobbies
   - Personal care

2. **Practice your chosen activities. Use the following tips to improve consistency.**
   - **Start small if needed.** Break activities into smaller pieces. Some activity is better than none.
   - **Make a plan.** Set an alarm as a reminder, or tie an activity to something you already do. For example, practice a hobby immediately after dinner every day.
   - **Bring a friend.** Including a friend will increase your commitment and make things more fun.

## Social Support

Social isolation is a common symptom of depression. Related issues—such as fatigue, lowered self-esteem, and anxiety—exacerbate this problem. Resisting social isolation, and instead leaning on social support, can improve resilience to stress and depression.

- **Lean on your existing relationships.** Make it a priority to socialize with friends or family every day.
- **Say "Yes" to socializing.** Overcome the habit of staying home, isolated from friends and family.
- **Join a support group.** Support groups let you connect with others who are dealing with issues similar to yours.
