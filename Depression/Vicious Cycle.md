# The Vicious Cycle of Depression

Depression is a multifaceted mental health issue characterized by a self-perpetuating cycle involving stressors, negative thoughts, feelings, physical symptoms, and behaviors.

## Stressors

Stressors trigger the cycle. They are situations that cause strain or hardship and can be either short-term or long-term.

## Negative Thought Patterns

Stressors often lead to negative, sometimes irrational or exaggerated thoughts such as:

- "I need to be perfect."
- "Nobody likes me."
- "I'm not good at anything."

## Feelings

Negative thoughts affect feelings, leading to emotions like sadness, anger, hopelessness, and loneliness.

## Physical Symptoms

The body's response to stress and negative thoughts includes:

- Fatigue
- Sleep problems
- Poor concentration
- Loss of motivation

## Behavioral Response

Behaviors in response to negative thoughts and feelings may include:

- Social isolation
- Abusing drugs/alcohol
- Neglecting daily tasks

These behaviors can worsen stressors, creating new ones and reinforcing the cycle.

## Reversing the Cycle

Breaking the cycle involves:

- **Increased Activity**: Engaging in activities to feel better, reduce stress, and think more clearly.
- **Changing Thinking Patterns**: Addressing negative thoughts to improve mood and motivation.
