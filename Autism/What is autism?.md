# What is Autism?

## 1. Definition

**Autism**, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a developmental disorder characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. It's called a "spectrum" because there's wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience.

Autistic individuals often display:

- **Social Communication Challenges**: Difficulties in understanding and maintaining conversation, non-verbal communication, and forming relationships.
- **Repetitive Behaviors**: Engaging in repetitive activities or speech.
- **Unique Strengths and Differences**: Many have exceptional abilities in visual and auditory skills, attention to detail, and others.

## 3. Spectrum Concept

ASD encompasses a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. There is no one type of autism, but many, with symptoms presenting in myriad combinations in each individual.

## 4. Causes and Diagnosis

While the exact causes of autism are not known, it's believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Diagnosis is based on behavior and development and often involves a team of specialists.

## 5. Support and Management

There's no 'one-size-fits-all' for managing autism. Strategies may include behavioral therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and personalized education plans. Early intervention can make a significant difference.
